                        Thanjavur is an important centre of silk weaving in Tamil Nadu. There were 200 silk weaving units in the 
                        city in 1991 with around 80,000 people working in them. Thanjavur is also famous for the 'Thalaiyatti bommai'
                         or 'Dancing dolls' which is a doll made from clay, wood or plastic.[58][60] The sarees produced in the
                          villages surrounding Thanjavur are sold in Thanjavur and neighbouring towns.[60] Increasing production 
                          costs and competition from large-scale producers have reduced the number of people involved in the production
                          The city produces bell metal craft like Thanjavur metal plates, bronze images bowls, napkins and powder boxes
                           made of copper and bronze. The city is a major manufacturer of pith works consisting of models of Hindu idols,
                            mosques, garlands and other bird figurines. Manufacture of musical instruments like <b>veena,tambura, violin, mrithamgam, thavil and kanjira</b>
                          is another economic activity in the city.
